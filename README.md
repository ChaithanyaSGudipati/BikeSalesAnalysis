# Bike Sales Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data. The key steps included data cleaning and standardization using Excel, followed by creating insightful dashboards to analyze and visualize the data. The dashboards provided actionable insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance, enabling better decision-making for business strategies.
